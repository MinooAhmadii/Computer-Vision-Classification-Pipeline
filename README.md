# Image Classification on CIFAR-10: Comparative Analysis of k-NN, SVM, and Neural Networks

## Project Description
A comprehensive implementation and comparison of three fundamental machine learning algorithms for image classification:
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**: Non-parametric classifier with weighted voting
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Linear classifier with hinge loss
- **Neural Network**: Parametric model with sigmoid activation

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Implementation of classification algorithms from scratch (using NumPy/PyTorch)
- Hyperparameter tuning and validation
- Performance comparison across different model complexities
- Understanding of loss functions and gradient computation
- Data preprocessing and train/validation/test splitting
